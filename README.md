# SYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR CAPABILITY CURVE GENERATOR
## Objective
This program was designed to create the capability curves of a synchronous generator given the machines' nominal parameters.

It comprises two functions:
1. **Capability Curve Generator:** generates the capability curve from the current limit curves for the rotor and stator
2. **Generator Capability Verification:** verify wheter a certain load condition can be achieved by a generator

## References
This code was developed using the concepts and electric machinery modeling from Chapman's "Electric Machinery Fundamentals" (5th edition) and Uman's "Fitzgerald & Kingsley's Electric Machinery" (7th edition).

The sections used were, respectively, 4.11 (Synchronous Generator Ratings - Synchronous Generator Capability Curves, p.254) and 5.5 (Steady-state Operating Characteristics, p.293).

Along with several mathematical and programming ideas that will be cited when approriate throught the code.
